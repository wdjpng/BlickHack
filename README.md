# BlickHack

A simple app that converts an image of the [Blick Live Quiz App](https://www.blick.ch/services/apps/livequiz/taeglich-mitspielen-und-geld-gewinnen-willkommen-beim-blick-live-quiz-id8820788.html) into a google search query using text recognition.

## Prerequisites

To test the application you will need a working installation of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).


## Installation

Firstly we will download the repository from GitHub

```
git clone https://github.com/wdjpng/BlickHack/
```
Then we will open the project in Android Studio
```
Click on Files ... Open and then select /path_to_your_files/BlickHack
```

After the Application is built (BlickHack: syncing... is replaced by Project setup: synced successfully)

## Running
After installing we can now [run the app](https://developer.android.com/studio/run). Now select an image or take a new one (by clicking on the respective icons) of a question from the [Blick Live Quiz App](https://www.blick.ch/services/apps/livequiz/taeglich-mitspielen-und-geld-gewinnen-willkommen-beim-blick-live-quiz-id8820788.html).

The application should now look something like this
